# Decisions

A short log of choices that would be expensive to change, with the reason. Add an entry whenever a decision is made or reversed. Newest at the bottom.

Format: what was decided, why, what was rejected, and when to revisit.

---

## D1. Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL

**Why:** the engine is algorithmic work that suits Python and its test tools; Next.js is the most widely used React setup; Postgres handles relational data with arrays and JSON.
**Rejected:** a single Next.js app with API routes (engine in TypeScript would be less natural to test and extend with ML later); Django (heavier than needed).
**Revisit if:** the two-service setup causes more deployment trouble than it is worth.

## D2. One repository

**Why:** one pull request can change the API and the UI together, and the docs live beside the code.
**Rejected:** separate repos.

## D3. Server-side sessions in an httpOnly cookie, API proxied through the frontend's domain

**Why:** simple, revocable, and safe from script access. Proxying makes the cookie first-party and removes CORS.
**Rejected:** JWT in local storage (readable by scripts, hard to revoke); a hosted auth service (less to learn, another dependency).
**Revisit if:** a mobile app is added.

## D4. The engine is deterministic; the AI only explains and converses

**Why:** testable, explainable, free to run, and works when the AI is down. It also stops the chatbot inventing items.
**Rejected:** asking a language model to pick outfits directly.
**Revisit if:** a learned compatibility model beats the rules on the golden set (see `ENGINE.md` section 14). Even then it would sit inside the engine, not replace it with a chat model.

## D5. Categories, colours, occasions, style profiles, and archetypes are data

**Why:** wardrobes vary enormously, especially across menswear, womenswear, and ethnic wear. Adding a garment type must not need a code change.
**Rejected:** enums in code.

## D6. No bulk scraping; product discovery through adapters

**Why:** scrapers against large retailers are brittle and usually against the sites' terms; the interesting work is ranking against a wardrobe. See `SHOPPING.md` part 2.
**Rejected:** scraping Myntra, Flipkart, and Amazon listings.
**Revisit if:** an official product API or feed is approved; add it as another adapter.

## D7. Deploy from M0; Vercel, Render, Neon, Cloudflare R2

**Why:** free to start, and deployment problems surface early. Neon over Render's free Postgres because the latter expires after 30 days. R2 because Render's free instances have no permanent disk.
**Rejected:** deploying at the end; a single VPS (more to manage while learning).
**Revisit if:** cold starts hurt demos, or the project becomes commercial.

## D8. Images are private and served through signed URLs

**Why:** wardrobe photos are personal and may show the user or their home.
**Rejected:** a public bucket.

## D9. Vertical slices, with v1.0 after M5

**Why:** each milestone ends with something real and deployed; a finished small app beats an unfinished large one.
**Rejected:** building all page shells first and wiring them later, which conflicts with "no fake functionality".

## D10. India first

**Why:** it is where the builder shops and dresses. Rupees, Indian retailers in search links, ethnic wear as first-class categories, and summer / monsoon / winter / mild as seasons.
**Revisit if:** other regions are added; seasons and retailers are already data.
